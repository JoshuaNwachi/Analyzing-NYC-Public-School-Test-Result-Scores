# New York City School SAT Performance
## by Nwachi Joshua

This project is an analysis of SAT scores across public schools in New York City. The database contains a single table, "schools," with information on the name of the school, the borough it is located in, its building code, average scores in math, reading, and writing, and the percentage of students who took the SATs. <br>

## The project includes the following steps:

1. Inspecting the data
2. Finding missing values
3. Schools by building code
4. Best schools for math
5. Lowest reading score

* In step 1, the data is displayed for the first ten schools in the database. 
* Step 2 calculates the number of schools with missing data for the "percent_tested" column and the total number of schools in the database. 
* In step 3, the number of unique school locations is calculated.
* In step 4, all schools with an average math score of at least 640 (out of 800) are displayed, ordered by largest to smallest average math score.
* In step 5, the schools with the lowest reading scores are analyzed.

The analysis is performed in SQL and the results are displayed in the form of tables.
